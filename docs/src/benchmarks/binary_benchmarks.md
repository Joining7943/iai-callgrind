# Binary Benchmarks

You want to start benchmarking your crate's binary? You've come to the right
place. Best start with the [Quickstart](./binary_benchmarks/quickstart.md)
section.

Setting up binary benchmarks is very similar to library benchmarks, and it's a
good idea to have a look at the [library benchmark](./library_benchmarks.md)
section of this guide, too.

Then come back to the binary benchmarks section and go through the
[differences](./binary_benchmarks/differences.md)

If you need more examples see [here](./binary_benchmarks/examples.md).
