# Binary Benchmarks

You want to start benchmarking your crate's binary? Best start with the
[Quickstart](./binary_benchmarks/quickstart.md) section.

Setting up binary benchmarks is very similar to library benchmarks, and it's a
good idea to have a look at the [library benchmark](./library_benchmarks.md)
section of this guide, too.

You may then come back to the binary benchmarks section and go through the
[differences](./binary_benchmarks/differences.md)

If you need more examples see [here](./binary_benchmarks/examples.md).
